        Frames brought reusability to increasingly sprawling websites. Frames allowed a web designer to assign, for example, a navbar HTML page to a frameset and have the same document load across many pages, with only the page's main content changing. This meant that repeated elements didn't have to be copy-pasted into numerous documents and kept up-to-date. Navigation and headers became more consistent.
        Your browser does not support frames
        However, frames had their downsides. Anyone who spent time browsing the web in the late 1990s remembers clicking on a link and seeing the content load within a tiny frame on the page. Or landing on a page with no navigation, because the link pointed to the individual frame HTML document instead of the frameset.

        Frames also wreaked havoc on search engines and primitive SEO, which relied more heavily on meta descriptions and keywords at the time. Often frame sub-pages were indexed, so visitors coming from search engines were often quite confused.

        Content within this tag is displayed to browsers that donâ€™t support frames. This was often used simply for a message: Your browser does not support frames. Often this would be followed by links to download the latest browser version. Netscape Navigator supported frames as of version 2.0 (September 1995), as did Internet Explorer (November 1995).
        Frame implementation
        The following is HTML code for a two column website frameset, which would go in the siteâ€™s index file. This is typical of what you would have seen for a navigation bar down the side of the page.

        Frames today
        If the aforementioned issues werenâ€™t enough to phase out frames, the explosion of mobile web browsing devices certainly did. Frames simply arenâ€™t usable on small screen devices. Today we achieve reusable content through content management systems (CMSes) and custom server-side code.
